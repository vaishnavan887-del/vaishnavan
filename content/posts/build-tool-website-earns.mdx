import { useState } from 'react'

export default function JSONFormatter() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('')
  const [output, setOutput] = useState('')
  const [error, setError] = useState('')

  const formatJSON = () => {
    try {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(input)
      setOutput(JSON.stringify(parsed, null, 2))
      setError('')
    } catch (e) {
      setError('Invalid JSON')
      setOutput('')
    }
  }

  const minifyJSON = () => {
    try {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(input)
      setOutput(JSON.stringify(parsed))
      setError('')
    } catch (e) {
      setError('Invalid JSON')
      setOutput('')
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>JSON Formatter</h1>
      <div className="editor">
        <textarea
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Paste your JSON here"
        />
        <div className="buttons">
          <button onClick={formatJSON}>Format</button>
          <button onClick={minifyJSON}>Minify</button>
        </div>
        {error && <div className="error">{error}</div>}
        <textarea
          value={output}
          readOnly
          placeholder="Formatted JSON will appear here"
