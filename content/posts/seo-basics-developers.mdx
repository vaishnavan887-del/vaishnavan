Search Engine Optimization (SEO) might seem like a marketing concern, but as a developer, you play a crucial role in making websites discoverable. Technical SEO is entirely in your hands, and getting it right can significantly impact your site's visibility. This guide provides a practical checklist of SEO basics every developer should know.

## Why Developers Should Care About SEO

- **Better User Experience**: SEO best practices often align with good UX
- **Career Growth**: SEO knowledge makes you more valuable
- **Client Satisfaction**: Better rankings = happier clients
- **Personal Projects**: Help your own projects get discovered

## 1. Meta Tags and Document Structure

### Title Tags

The title tag is one of the most important SEO elements:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<title>How to Learn React in 2024 | Developer Blog</title>

<!-- Bad -->
<title>Home</title>
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep under 60 characters
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Make it descriptive and compelling
- Unique for each page

### Meta Descriptions

While not a direct ranking factor, descriptions influence click-through rates:

```html
<meta 
  name="description" 
  content="Learn React from scratch with this comprehensive guide. Includes examples, best practices, and real-world projects."
/>
```

**Best Practices:**
- 150-160 characters
- Include a call to action
- Make it compelling
- Unique for each page

### Open Graph Tags

For better social media sharing:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="How to Learn React in 2024" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Comprehensive React tutorial..." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yoursite.com/og-image.jpg" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://yoursite.com/article" />
<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
```

## 2. Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML elements for better SEO and accessibility:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Article Title</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Section Title</h2>
      <p>Content...</p>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>Footer content</footer>
</article>

<!-- Bad -->
<div>
  <div>Article Title</div>
  <div>Content...</div>
</div>
```

**Benefits:**
- Search engines understand content structure
- Better accessibility
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## 3. Heading Hierarchy

Use headings logically (H1 → H2 → H3):

```html
<h1>Main Page Title</h1>
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <h3>Subsection Title</h3>
      <h4>Sub-subsection</h4>
```

**Rules:**
- One H1 per page
- Don't skip heading levels
- Use headings for structure, not styling

## 4. URL Structure

Clean, descriptive URLs help SEO:

```
✅ Good: /blog/react-performance-tips
❌ Bad: /blog/post?id=123
❌ Bad: /blog/post-1
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Keep URLs short and descriptive
- Include keywords when natural
- Use lowercase
- Avoid unnecessary parameters

## 5. Image Optimization

Images need proper optimization and alt text:

```html
<img 
  src="optimized-image.webp" 
  alt="Developer working on React project"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

**Checklist:**
- Descriptive alt text (not "image1.jpg")
- Appropriate file formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Proper sizing (don't scale down large images)
- Lazy loading for below-fold images
- Responsive images with srcset

## 6. Internal Linking

Link to other pages on your site:

```html
<a href="/blog/nextjs-tips">Learn more about Next.js</a>
```

**Benefits:**
- Helps search engines discover pages
- Distributes page authority
- Improves user navigation
- Reduces bounce rate

## 7. Mobile Responsiveness

Mobile-first is essential:

- Use responsive design
- Test on real devices
- Ensure touch targets are adequate
- Avoid Flash and other unsupported technologies

Google uses mobile-first indexing, so mobile experience directly impacts rankings.

## 8. Page Speed

Fast pages rank better and provide better UX:

**Key Metrics:**
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Minimize JavaScript
- Optimize images
- Use CDN
- Enable compression (Gzip/Brotli)
- Minimize render-blocking resources
- Use browser caching

## 9. Structured Data (Schema.org)

Help search engines understand your content:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "How to Learn React",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Vaishnavan"
  },
  "datePublished": "2024-01-25",
  "description": "Comprehensive guide to learning React..."
}
```

**Common Types:**
- Article
- Organization
- BreadcrumbList
- FAQPage
- Product

## 10. robots.txt

Control what search engines can crawl:

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /api/

Sitemap: https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml
```

## 11. XML Sitemap

Help search engines discover all your pages:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://yoursite.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2024-01-25</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

Submit to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.

## 12. HTTPS

HTTPS is required for good SEO:

- Google marks HTTP sites as "not secure"
- HTTPS is a ranking signal
- Required for many modern web features
- Better user trust

## 13. Canonical URLs

Prevent duplicate content issues:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://yoursite.com/blog/article" />
```

Use when:
- You have multiple URLs for the same content
- Using URL parameters
- Having both www and non-www versions

## 14. 404 Pages

Create helpful 404 pages:

- Don't just show "Page Not Found"
- Include navigation
- Suggest popular content
- Make it searchable
- Keep it on-brand

## 15. Analytics and Search Console

Set up tracking:

- **Google Analytics**: User behavior
- **Google Search Console**: Search performance, indexing issues
- **Bing Webmaster Tools**: Additional insights

## Next.js Specific SEO

If using Next.js:

```jsx
import { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title',
  description: 'Page description',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Page Title',
    description: 'Page description',
    images: ['/og-image.jpg'],
  },
}
```

Next.js handles:
- Automatic sitemap generation
- robots.txt generation
- Optimized images
- Automatic code splitting

## Testing Your SEO

Use these tools:

- **Google Search Console**: Monitor search performance
- **Lighthouse**: SEO audit
- **PageSpeed Insights**: Performance and SEO
- **Schema Markup Validator**: Test structured data
- **Mobile-Friendly Test**: Check mobile usability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keyword Stuffing**: Natural language is better
2. **Duplicate Content**: Use canonical tags
3. **Ignoring Mobile**: Mobile-first is essential
4. **Slow Pages**: Speed matters
5. **Missing Alt Text**: Images need descriptions
6. **Broken Links**: Regular audits needed
7. **Thin Content**: Provide substantial, valuable content
