## Cookie Consent Implementation

### Legal Requirements

Different regulations have different requirements:

**GDPR (EU):**
- Explicit consent required
- Granular consent options
- Easy to withdraw consent
- Clear information about cookies

**CCPA (California):**
- Opt-out mechanism required
- "Do Not Sell" option
- Clear disclosure of data sales

**ePrivacy Directive:**
- Consent before non-essential cookies
- Information about cookie purposes

### Cookie Consent Banner Best Practices

#### 1. Clear and Prominent

- Visible without scrolling
- Not hidden or obscured
- Clear language (avoid legal jargon)

#### 2. Granular Options

Allow users to choose:

```javascript
// Example consent options
{
  essential: true, // Required, can't be disabled
  analytics: false, // User choice
  advertising: false, // User choice
  functional: false // User choice
}
```

#### 3. Easy to Understand

Use plain language:

```
✅ Good: "We use cookies to improve your experience and show you relevant ads."
❌ Bad: "This website utilizes HTTP cookies and local storage mechanisms..."
```

#### 4. Persistent Choice

- Remember user's choice
- Don't ask repeatedly
- Allow changing preferences

#### 5. Link to Full Policy

- Provide link to detailed cookie policy
- Explain each cookie category
- List specific cookies used

### Implementation Example

Here's a basic cookie consent implementation:

```javascript
// Cookie consent logic
function showCookieBanner() {
  const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')
  if (!consent) {
    // Show banner
    displayBanner()
  }
}

function acceptCookies() {
  localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'accepted')
  localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent-date', new Date().toISOString())
  // Load analytics and advertising scripts
  loadAnalytics()
  loadAds()
  hideBanner()
}

function rejectCookies() {
  localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'rejected')
  // Only load essential scripts
  hideBanner()
}

// Check consent before loading scripts
function loadAnalytics() {
  const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')
  if (consent === 'accepted') {
    // Load Google Analytics
    // gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID')
  }
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Copying Another Site's Policy**: Must be specific to your site
2. **Using Legal Jargon**: Write in plain language
3. **Not Updating**: Keep policy current with your practices
4. **Missing Required Sections**: Include all applicable sections
5. **No Contact Information**: Users need ways to reach you
