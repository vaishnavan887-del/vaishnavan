     data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"
     data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXXX"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
```

### AdSense with Next.js

If using Next.js, use next/script:

```jsx
import Script from 'next/script'

<Script
  async
  src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>
```

### ads.txt File

Create an `ads.txt` file in your root directory:

```
google.com, pub-XXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

This verifies you own the domain and helps prevent ad fraud.
